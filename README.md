# ReactApp
Student Form using React.js

Hi,
In this Student form React app you can add a student, display student list, delete a student, update student, and search for students. In the frontend folder you will find the design of the page and all the components. In the backend you will find the routes and the mongoDB file ( Database). 

Step 1: open the backhand folder in the terminal and use the following commands npm install and then npm start.
Step 2: open the frontend folder in a new terminal and use the following commands npm install and then npm start. Wait a couple seconds and the application will open in your browser by itself.
